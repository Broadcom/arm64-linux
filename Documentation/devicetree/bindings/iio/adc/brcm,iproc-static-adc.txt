* Broadcom's IPROC Static ADC controller

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "brcm,iproc-static-adc"

- #address-cells: Specify the number of u32 entries needed in child nodes.
  Should set to 1.

- #size-cells: Specify number of u32 entries needed to specify child nodes size
  in reg property. Should set to 1.

- adc-syscon: Handler of syscon node defining physical base address of the
  controller and length of memory mapped region.

- #io-channel-cells = <1>; As ADC has multiple outputs
  refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt for details.

- clocks: Clock used for this block.

- clock-names: Clock name should be given as tsc_clk.

- interrupts: interrupt line number.

For example:

	ts_adc_syscon: ts_adc_syscon@180a6000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-ts-adc-syscon","syscon";
		reg = <0x180a6000 0xc30>;
	};

	adc: adc@180a6000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-static-adc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		adc-syscon = <&ts_adc_syscon>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		io-channel-ranges;
		clocks = <&asiu_clks BCM_CYGNUS_ASIU_ADC_CLK>;
		clock-names = "tsc_clk";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 164 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Broadcom iProc Shared MDIO Controller

Required properties:
- compatible:
    "brcm,iproc-shared-mdio" for shared MDIO controller.
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers
- reg-names: should be "mdio"
- #address-cells: must be 1.
- #size-cells: must be 0.

optional:
child nodes: Masters are represented as a child node of shared MDIO controller
and all the PHYs handled by this master are represented as its child node.

Master nodes properties are defined as-

Required properties:
- compatible: Used to match driver of this PHY.
- reg: MDIO master ID.
- #address-cells: must be 1.
- #size-cells: must be 0.

optional:
-brcm,phy-internal: if presents, PHYs are internal. Absence shows phy is
external.
-brcm,is-c45: if presents, Controller uses Clause-45 to issue MDIO transaction.
else Controller uses Clause-22 for transactions.

PHY nodes are represented as the child node of Master. Child nodes properties
are defined as-

Required properties:
-reg: phy id of attached PHY.

optional:
There could be additional properties required to configure the specific phy like
phy-mode in case of gpphy node below. These should be defined here and used by
respective drivers.

Example:
iproc_mdio: iproc_mdio@663f0000 {
	compatible = "brcm,iproc-shared-mdio";
	reg = <0x6602023c 0x14>;
	reg-names = "mdio";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	sata-master@6 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-ns2-sata-phy";
		reg = <0x6>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		brcm,phy-internal;

		sata_phy0: sata-phy@1 {
			reg = <0x1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		sata_phy1: sata-phy@2 {
			reg = <0x2>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

	eth-master@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-mdio-master-eth";
		reg = <0x0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		gphy0: eth-phy@10 {
			reg = <0x10>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
		};
	};
};

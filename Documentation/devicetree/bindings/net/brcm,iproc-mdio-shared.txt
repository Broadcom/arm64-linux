Broadcom Ethernet master for shared mdio controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,iproc-mdio-master-eth"
- reg: master id of Ethernet block
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number
- phy-mode: media type connecting the PHY and MAC.


Example:
	eth-master@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-mdio-master-eth";
		reg = <0x0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		gphy0: eth-phy@10 {
			reg = <0x10>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
		};
		status = "ok"
	};

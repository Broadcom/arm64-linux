Properties for an MDIO bus mutiplexer found in Broadcom iProc based SoCs.

This MDIO bus multiplexer defines buses that could be internal as well as
external to SoCs and could accept MDIO transaction compatible to C-22 or
C-45 Clause. When Child bus is selected, one need to select these two
properties as well to generate desired MDIO trascation on appropriate bus.

Required properties in addition to the generic multiplexer properties:

MDIO multiplexer node:
- complatible: brcm,mdio-mux-iproc.

Child bus node:
-brcm,is-c45: Boolean property indicating PHYs attached to this bus supports
	      C-45 mdio transaction.

Every non-ethernet PHY requires a compatible so that it could be probed based
on this compatible string.

Additional information regarding generic multiplexer properties could be found
at- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/mdio-mux.txt


for example:
		mdio_mux_iproc: mdio_mux_iproc@6602023c {
			compatible = "brcm,mdio-mux-iproc";
			reg = <0x6602023c 0x14>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			mdio-integrated-mux;

			mdio@0 {
				reg = <0x0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				pci_phy0: pci-phy@0 {
					compatible = "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy";
					reg = <0x0>;
					#phy-cells = <0>;
				};
			};

			mdio@7 {
				reg = <0x7>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				pci_phy1: pci-phy@0 {
					compatible = "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy";
					reg = <0x0>;
					#phy-cells = <0>;
				};
			};
			mdio@10 {
				reg = <0x10>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				gphy0: eth-phy@10 {
					reg = <0x10>;
				};
			};
		};
